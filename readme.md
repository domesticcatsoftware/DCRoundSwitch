Our commercial apps: [domesticcat.com.au](http://domesticcat.com.au/apps)

About
-----

DCRoundSwitch is designed to be a drop in replacement for UISwitch.  It is styled 'modern' so will unify the look of your apps into the future whilst retaining backwards capability.  Drawing is done in CoreGraphics so no images are required.

It should behave exactly the same as a UISwitch API wise, if it doesn't please file a bug, or preferably send me a pull request.
